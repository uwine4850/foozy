## Welcome to the foozy documentation!

foozy is a framework focused on flexibility and extensibility. Most of the framework components depend on interfaces, so they are easy to replace. For example, the `mapper` package can be omitted, as can the `form` package. Also, the framework has several built-in packages for convenience, such as the `auth` package for working with users.

You can read more about the other packages in the rest of the documentation.

An [example of a project](https://github.com/uwine4850/alllogs) written using the framework.

For example, you can look at the [getting started section](getting_started.md).
